Maintain update the dll "Souls Memory" of Souls Splitter for last updates fixes of readEventsFlags or others things

Notes:
===========================================
AutoSplitting:
- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When a event of autosplit happen, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use "Reset Run" button or Shortcut, for reset this state.

- In difference of souls memory for souls games, Hollow Knight use a dll that is completely integrate with livesplit core so is impossible separation of them
