Notes:
===========================================
AutoSplitting:
-To activate any autosplitting you should select in main program "Game to Split".

- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When a event of autosplit happen, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use "Reset Run" button or Shortcut, for reset this state.

- If you want auto reset internal flags to split all Pantheon bosses in hollow autosplitter.
If you want play P1+P2+P3+P4 to play P5 after, or P5 to play P1....P4 after 
You should check "Grey Prince Zote" if you run, have this boss or not.
(Turn on/off depending the case)

- Currently Elden Ring is only supported with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
To disable Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game"
Launching the game from "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\eldenring.exe" will run elden ring without EAC.

- Split by Attributes and some custom flags in DS3 dont work on versions previous to 1.15

- ASL Method can read whateaver ASL file (AutoSplit Language to Livesplit) and split with them. Dont use ASL that no have autospliting and 
if the game is into this plugin Sekiro,ds1,ds2,etc.
Browse the file with .asl extencion and clic on "Update Script" if this dont show configuration after 5 seconds.
Special Case: Cuphead; This is controlled by dll file but this is outdate, only works in versions previous to 
The Delicious Last Course, and community livesplit made a asl that work with the dll, here dont work so, we waiting
to creator update the dll.
