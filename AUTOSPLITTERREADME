===========================================
AutoSplitting:
-To activate any autosplitting you should select in main program "Game to Split".

- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When a event of autosplit happen, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use "Reset Run" button or Shortcut, for reset this state.

- If you want auto reset internal flags to split all Pantheon bosses in hollow autosplitter.
If you want play P1+P2+P3+P4 to play P5 after, or P5 to play P1....P4 after 
You should check "Grey Prince Zote" if you run, have this boss or not.
(Turn on/off depending the case)

- Currently Elden Ring is only supported with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
To disable Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game"
Launching the game from "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\eldenring.exe" will run elden ring without EAC.

- Split by Attributes and some custom flags in DS3 dont work on versions previous to 1.15
