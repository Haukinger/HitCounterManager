## Get the software
All available releases can be found at the [Releases page](../../releases) on GitHub.

## Installation

### Systemrequirements
* OS: Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 or newer (32/64 bit)
  * Portable version (ZIP)
    * [.Net Framework 2.0 or newer](https://www.microsoft.com/net)
    > Note: Version 1.13 and older requires [.Net Framework 4.5 or newer](https://www.microsoft.com/net)
  * Installer version (Setup)
    * [.Net Framework 4.5 or newer](https://www.microsoft.com/net)
* OS: Any (32/64 bit)
  * Portable version (ZIP)
    * [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) (_tested with 5.14.0_)  
      Run the application in the application's directory with **mono HitCounterManager.exe**  
      **Note**: The Non-Windows / Mono version does not support global hot keys

### Designs / Fonts

A specific font can be selected at the appearance dialog in two ways:
* The font is already installed locally on the system
  * _(Not required but recommended)_ Clear the field for the font URL as no external font must be loaded
  * Enter your font family name of choice at the font name field and hit Apply
  > Example: _sans-serif_ or _courier_
* The font is **not** installed locally and must be loaded from an external _@font-face_ ressource
  * Enter the URL to the ressource into the font URL field
  * Enter the matching font family name at the font name field and hit Apply
  > Example: URL _https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fontdiner+Swanky_ and name _Fontdiner Swanky_

To find suitable fonts I can recommend Google's font collection: [https://fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com).  
Search for one of your liking and see the embedded font and/or CSS instruction as you can simply copy URL and name from there into the application. For the previous example the instructions looked like this _(the part to copy in bold)_:
> URL from Embed Font instructions:  
> _&lt;link href="**https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fontdiner+Swanky**" rel="stylesheet"&gt;_  
> Name from CSS instructions:  
> _font-family: '**Fontdiner Swanky**', cursive;_

## Modders and developers

### Using standalone web browser instead of broadcasting software
* When no data is displayed, there could be a problem with cross-domain security settings that can be avoided by allowing acces to local files in general:
  * **Chrome**
    * Start with command line option **--allow-file-access-from-files**
    > Example: _"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files_
  * **Firefox**
    * Change the security policy in the browser settings **about:config -> security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy -> false**
    > Note: This is a global settings, means you should enable this only for offline/trusted websites!
  * **Internet Explorer 11**
    * Accepting the initially blocked execution of the script should be sufficient
  * **Edge**
    * No issues here so far

### Changing layout and design
You can modify or create new custom designs. Simply modify or create a new HTML, CSS or Javascript files based on any of the pre-delivered designs. For example, the style like **background color, font color or sizes can be easily modified in the CSS files**.  
You can modify the [HitCounter.template](Sources/HitCounter.template) which comes with the installation or you can create an own template file to set custom settings for your designs at a single location.  
> The application is using JavaScript syntax when writing data into the output file. Therefore the template has to have a line with the text **HITCOUNTER_LIST_START** which is the starting mark. The mark with all further lines will be replaced with the JavaScript equivalent of the application's current data. This replacement is done until the **HITCOUNTER_LIST_END** text mark is reached.  
Eventually it means **you are 100% free in the design of your hit counter**.
