Maintain update the dll "Souls Memory" of Souls Splitter for last updates fixes of readEventsFlags or others things

Notes:
===========================================
AutoSplitting:
- Is recommended to configure everything before setting the game to spliter, to avoid autosplitting

-Depends on Configurable Autosplit, the addons autosplitting a split (+1 in the actually position), 
regardless of what is written on them

- When a event of autosplit happen, an internal variable is set, for evit that event is repit. 
Use "Reset Run" button or Shortcut, for reset this state.

- In difference of souls memory for souls games, Hollow Knight use a dll that is completely integrate with livesplit core
 so is impossible separation of them

-If you want auto reset internal flags to split all Pantheon bosses in hollow autosplitter.
If you want play P1+P2+P3+P4 to play P5 after, or P5 to play P1....P4 after 
You should check "Grey Prince Zote" if you run, have this boss or not.
(Turn on/off depending the case)

- Currently Elden Ring is only supported with Easy Anti-Cheat disabled.
To disable Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game" and create a new text file called "steam_appid.txt" without quotes, and set it's contents to "1245620" without quotes. 
Launching the game from "Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\eldenring.exe" will run elden ring without EAC, launching the game from steam will have EAC enabled.
